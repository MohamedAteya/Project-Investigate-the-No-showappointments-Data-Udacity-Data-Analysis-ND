## Introduction

This dataset collects information
from 100k medical appointments in
Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up
for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are
included in each row.

#### Questions to answer: 
* What is the appointment show-up vs no show-up rate?
* How the age of the patients affects the show-up? 
* How Scholarship affects the show-up?
* How receiving SMS affects the patients show-up?
* How Gender of the patient affects his/her show-up?
* How the weekday affect the show-up?
